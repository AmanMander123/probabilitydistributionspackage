# distributionsgeneral
Python package for doing calculations on probability distributions.  
Currently supports the Gaussian and Binomial distributions.  

# Usage
```python
from distributions import Gaussian
from distributions import Binomial

gendist = Distribution(5, 2)

print(gendist.mean)
print(gendist.stdev)
gendist.read_data_file('numbers.txt')
print(gendist.mean)
print(gendist.stdev)

gaussdist = Gaussian()
gaussdist.read_data_file('numbers.txt')
gaussdist.calculate_mean()
gaussdist.calculate_stdev()
print(gaussdist)
gaussdist.plot_histogram()
gaussdist.plot_histogram_pdf()
print(gaussdist)
print(gaussdist.calculate_confidence_intervals(0.99))

bidist = Binomial(0.4, 20)
bidist.read_data_file('numbers_binomial.txt')
bidist.replace_stats_with_data()
bidist.plot_bar_pdf()
print(bidist)
```

# Installation
Install using pip:

pip install distributionsgeneral

You can find the project on PyPi here:

# Files
The main classes are inside the distributions folder.
- Generaldistributions.py is the base class
- Gaussiandistribution.py and BinomialDistribution.py are the subclasses of Generaldistribution.py
- numbers.txt and numbers_binomial.py are the sample data files
- tests.py contains unittests for the package
